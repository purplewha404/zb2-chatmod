# ChatMod for Zumbi Blocks 2 Open Alpha
This mod adds an in-game chat to chat with users within the current lobby rather than using Discord or other chatting app to message each other.
**Your friend or other users must have this mod installed to play with you, if they dont have the mod, they wont be able to connect.**
**You cant join lobbies with people who dont have the mod installed.**
